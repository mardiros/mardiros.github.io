## Python Libraries

### Blacksmith

[blacksmith](https://mardiros.github.io/blacksmith/) is a library to build a solid
microservices architecture based on REST API in Python 3. It support both synchronous
and asynchronous code based on asyncio.

It is not an http client, it embed some features like service discovery, metrics,
circuit breaker, and more.

The full documentation is here: [https://mardiros.github.io/blacksmith/](https://mardiros.github.io/blacksmith/).

The project is stable and mature.

Some web framework integration exists that are extra packages:

* [dj-blacksmith - blacksmith for Django](https://mardiros.github.io/dj-blacksmith/)
* [pyramid-blacksmith - blacksmith for Pyramid](https://mardiros.github.io/pyramid-blacksmith/)

### Messagebus

[messagebus](https://mardiros.github.io/messagebus/) is a library to build an event driven
architecture in Python 3. It support both synchronous and asynchronous code based on asyncio.

This library is not published on PyPI yet and is awaiting for a
[PEP 541 Request](https://github.com/pypi/support/issues/2962).

The full documentation is here: [https://mardiros.github.io/messagebus/](https://mardiros.github.io/messagebus/).

This project is not production ready yet.
